# Prepare_Kali_VM
Prepare_Kali_Tools

How to run:

<pre><code>curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trickster0/Prepare_Kali_VM/master/script.sh | sh </code></pre>

ps. The command should be executed as sudo. Latest Kali version creates a user so put sudo if you are using kali 2020.1.
I personally use 2019.4 and keep updating it.
